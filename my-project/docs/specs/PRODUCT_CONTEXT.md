**Making empathy contagious.**

```

They often record others' stories rather than their own.

## Key UX Rules

1. **One pass allowed** — Can skip first prompt, must accept second
2. **No prompt shopping** — Can't browse prompts before spinning
3. **Audio only** — No typed stories
4. **5-minute max** — Recording duration limit
5. **Facilitation hints** — Show for declaration-risk prompts

## Stories vs. Declarations

| ❌ Declaration | ✅ Story |
|----------------|----------|
| "My resilience" | "The night I almost gave up..." |
| "I value honesty" | "There was this time I had to tell a hard truth..." |

## Aesthetic

**Steampunk time machine** — mechanical, warm, tactile, analog soul.

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Brass, amber, wood | Cold blues, whites |
