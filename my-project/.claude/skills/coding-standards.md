# Coding Standards

## General Principles

1. **Readability First**: Code should be easy to read and understand
2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication
3. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple solutions

## Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and components
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that convey purpose

## Code Structure

- Keep functions small (under 20 lines when possible)
- Single responsibility per function/class
- Group related code together
- Use consistent formatting (Prettier/ESLint)

## Comments

- Write self-documenting code first
- Add comments for complex logic
- Document public APIs with JSDoc/TSDoc
- Avoid obvious comments
